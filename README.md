This is a simple Todo List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add and remove items from their todo list dynamically.

Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
You will see an input field where you can enter your todo items and a "Add Item" button to add them to the list.
Each todo item will be displayed along with a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
Features
Add Todo Item: Enter a todo item in the input field and click the "Add Item" button to add it to the list.
Remove Todo Item: Click the "Delete" button next to a todo item to remove it from the list.
